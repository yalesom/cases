    MediaCore Drupal Filter & WYSIWYG Editor Button 

Two aspects of this module work together to give you a seamless MediaCore 
experience from within Drupal. WYSIWYG integration (supports TinyMCE, CKEditor,
or FCKEditor) gives you a new button while editing content; click it and your 
videos are right there! Just select which one you'd like to embed, and we'll 
insert a shortcode for it in your content. The content filter turns these 
shortcodes into the appropriate code so that your video appears right within 
your page.

===Shortcode example:===
[mediacore:http://demo.mediacore.tv/media/trap-jaw-ants width:560 height:315]


==INSTALLATION==

1) With the "mediacoreinsert" folder in your modules directory, enable the module.

2) Go to your "Input Formats" settings page and enable the filter. Be sure that it 
is placed above the "Filter HTML" filter, or it won't work.

3) If you're using the WYSIWYG module, go to your WYSIWYG settings and, under 
"Buttons and Plugins," check the "mediacoreinsert" box.

4) Go to your "MediaCore Insert" settings and make sure to fill in your 
MediaCore URL (e.g. change it from demo.mediacore.tv to yoursite.mediacore.tv)
