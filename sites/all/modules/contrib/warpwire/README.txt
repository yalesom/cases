The Warpwire module allows for the embedding of Warpwire content within Drupal,
via a WYWIWYG integration, the CKEditor, or directly.

An example of an embeddable Warpwire asset is as follows:

[warpwire:https://example.warpwire.com/w/AAAAAA/]

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Modules
 * At least one of the following:
   
   - Wysiwyg - Allows the use of client-side editors to edit content.
               Requires either the CKEditor or TinyMCE Wysiwyg editor to be enabled
 	            (https://www.drupal.org/project/wysiwyg)

   - CKEditor - WYSIWYG text editor.


INSTALLATION

The Warpwire module can be installed via the standard Drupal installation process

/sites/all/modules/ - the resulting folder will be /sites/all/modules/warpwire.

Warpwire can be installed to function utilizing either the Wysiwyg or CKEditor modules.  Instructions
for configuring Warpwire within each configuration follow below:

   'warpwire'.  The resulting folder would, in a default installation, be located
   at /sites/all/modules/ckeditor/plugins/warpwire/

   installation):

      - From within the 'ckeditor' folder, copy the html and images folders, and the plugin.js 
        file, to the folder created in Step(1) above.  The resulting files and folders would be
        as follows:
         * /sites/all/modules/ckeditor/plugins/warpwire/html/
         * /sites/all/modules/ckeditor/plugins/warpwire/images/
