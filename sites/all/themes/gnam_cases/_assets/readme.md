#Gulp file instructions

##Do NOT put node_modules into github, it is a HUGE waste of storage

The packages.json file allows you to install the needed modules.

1. make sure you have node.js and npm installed
2. in the '_assets' folder run the following command

```npm install```

3. Once the needed modules are installed now just run gulp

```gulp```
